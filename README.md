## Client

The client contains the code which you will modify as part of the course. It constitutes the frontend (UI) portion of this web application.

In the `client` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\


### `npm run prod`

This is a combination of `npm run build` and python3 `http.server`. This will start a new web server that hosts your app at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002). Rather than talking to your local environment, it will talk to a live, production server.

## Server

The server contains the backend code which. 
In the `server` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server in development mode.
